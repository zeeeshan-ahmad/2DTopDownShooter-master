The scripts in this folder were NOT used for the scaffold build, however they are way more versatile
than "PlayerHealth" and can be use for any entity in the game that has health. This scripts
were not used, since they were not the best scripts for beginner programmers, but I decided
to include them in case any programmer wants to check or even use them.

HealthPool: uses UnityEvents which work like OnClick() on a UI button object. Meaning that in the Unity
console editor you can insert a script and specify which method you wanna call when such event is trigger.

PlayerHealthBar: is way shorter than the PlayerHealth script provided, this is due to the versatility and
usefulness of the HealthPool.
